# 🌍 ChainFund Portfolio — Building Africa's Financial Future

Welcome to the personal portfolio of **Philani A. Dlamini**, Co-Founder of ChainFund — a platform that showcases my work across decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain architecture, token infrastructure, and inclusive fintech innovation across Africa.

This portfolio is not just a personal site; it is a **living roadmap** of what we are building with ChainFund — a consultation-first, product-driven company focused on bridging the gap between **traditional finance (TradFi)** and **decentralized finance (DeFi)** to solve real financial challenges across Africa.
